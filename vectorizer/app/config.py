"""Runtime configuration for the raster-to-SVG vectorizer.

Values come from the MVP spec (docs/research/IMAGE_TO_SVG_MVP_SPEC.md).
Everything here is a tunable knob — real generated bracelet images will
almost certainly force us to loosen the fidelity gates, so keep them here
and load from the environment rather than hard-coding at call sites.
